# SUBMIT ON THE WEBSITE, NOT THROUGH THIS SCRIPT. Modrinth's submission form asks for an
# **AI-use declaration**, and v2 does not expose it - there is no such field anywhere in the
# published spec. A PATCH to `requested_status` therefore submits a project that has answered
# nothing, on a platform whose no-generative-AI review had already rejected our shield logo. Not
# worth it to save one click.
#
# So this prints what is about to be submitted and stops. The API path is still here behind
# MODRINTH_ALLOW_API_SUBMIT=1, for a RE-submission on a project whose declaration already exists.
#
# Modrinth will not accept a project with no versions, so upload at least one jar first.

   The submission form asks for an AI-use declaration that the v2 API does not expose, so
   submitting through the API answers it with nothing. Given Modrinth's no-generative-AI review is
   what rejected our shield logo, that is not a form to skip.

   (Re-submitting a project whose declaration already exists? MODRINTH_ALLOW_API_SUBMIT=1.)
