#
# Normally run for you by .github/workflows/modrinth.yml when a GitHub release is published, so
# publishing to GitHub publishes to Modrinth as well as CurseForge. Runnable by hand for a re-upload.
#
# ZombieMod ships a jar per Minecraft version, and each becomes its OWN Modrinth version rather than
# three files on one. Modrinth version numbers must be unique within a project, so the version
# number carries the +mc suffix the jar already has: 3.4.0+mc1.21.11, 3.4.0+mc26.2, and so on. That
# also means the Minecraft version can be read off the filename, exactly as the CurseForge upload
# does - this workflow only ever checks out the tag's ref, so gradle.properties there describes one
# of the three and would mislabel the other two.
